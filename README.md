Hey! So this is my new account, and I am also currently trying to make a genesis emulator in pygame (SEE HERE, NO C, ONE FILE) https://github.com/3duser-sys/Sega-Genesis-emulator-COMPLETELY-PYTHON (I DONT THINK I HAVE PUT ANYTHING THERE YET SRRY)

This is just a fun project based on SM I guess.

NO LEVELS YET, But if you fo into sonic pygame test folder, you will see a sonic in green hill. (DOESNT WORK!!!! RUN AT YOUR OWN TIME WASTE!!!)
