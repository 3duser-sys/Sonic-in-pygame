Hey! So this is my new account, and I am also currently trying to make a genesis emulator in pygame (SEE HERE, NO C, ONE FILE) https://github.com/3duser-sys/Sega-Genesis-emulator-COMPLETELY-PYTHON (HELP ME WITH IT I NEED HEP!!!!!!)

This is just a fun project based on SM I guess.

There may be even an error :( Sonic in green hill. SOON I SAY SOON!

Anyway, in releases there is a version in windows executable. 

Including the folder (recommended use)
